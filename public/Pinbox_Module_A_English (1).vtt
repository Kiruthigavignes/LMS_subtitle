00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.780


2
00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.719
We all want to live a happy life with

3
00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.040
our loved ones,

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.839
to take care of the things that are

5
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.539
important to us and to reach our goals

6
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.260
and fulfill our dreams.

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.840
To a large extent our ability to achieve

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.140
our goals and meet our future needs

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.720
depend on how well we manage our money

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.739
today, both our income and our expenses.

11
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.920
For this we should regularly review and

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.680
balance our expenses and income so that

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.440
we don't spend more than we earn and are

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.660
able to regularly set aside some money

15
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.840
for things that we may want or need in

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.539
the future. The best education for our

17
00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.120
children or our own home

18
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.300
or a happy and secure retirement,

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.680
but is it that simple? Not really, we need

20
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.559
to be very careful about a clever little

21
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.460
devil called inflation,

22
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.900
it keeps reducing the value of our

23
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.600
income and also keeps eating into our

24
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.420
savings over time.

25
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.119
Inflation is what causes the prices of

26
00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.060
everyday items to rise year after year

27
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.640
and the value of our money to keep

28
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.460
reducing over time, all because of

29
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.080
inflation.

30
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.600
So, 10 years later,

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.880
a basket of tomatoes would cost much

32
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.119
more than it does today. Or we can say

33
00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.700
with the same amount of money we will be

34
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.220
able to buy less tomatoes than we can

35
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.579
today.

36
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.380
Therefore

37
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.500
when we save a part of our income we

38
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.840
must ensure that the interest we earn on

39
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.119
our savings is more than the rate of

40
00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.320
inflation.

41
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.479
If inflation is higher than the interest

42
00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.240
we earn the value of our money will go

43
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.060
down, and if we keep our savings in cash

44
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.700
at home we won't earn any interest at

45
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.940
all and therefore very soon inflation

46
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.860
would eat away most of our savings.

47
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.300
Keeping a part of our savings in the

48
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.680
bank on the other hand is a good idea,

49
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.160
that way our money is safe and earns an

50
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.060
interest to help us beat inflation.

51
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.220
With careful budgeting and financial

52
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.720
planning

53
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.780
we can fulfill all our goals and dreams

54
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.640
and also stay ahead of inflation.
